    I'm not just a computer scientist! Even if I like spending time on projects that motivate me, I surely enjoy reading and sunbathing as well. If I had to suggest you a book and a place where to read it, I would recommed Jorge Amado's "Gabriela, cravo e canela", on the raw greek island Ikaria. Whenever I want to get some endorphines into my system I go for a ride on my road bike to challenge the steep Bolognese hills or I plan a nice hike on the friulian alps. My remaining free time is swallowed up by <a href="https://linktr.ee/mercatovez">Il Mercatovecchio</a>, the band in which I play the trumpet. We are a noisy and energic group of eight. When we are not playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morra_(game)">morra</a>, we stay in a messy-notlargeenough-crowded room in which we play italian Indie-Rock music filled with the sound of brass.
