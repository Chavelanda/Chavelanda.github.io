  title="An AlphaZero approach to Watten"
  link="https://github.com/Chavelanda/offen-watten-alpha-zero"
  inverted=""
  content="As thesis project for my bachelor degree, I developed a program following the AlphaZero approach that produces competitive models for an incomplete information game: Watten, a popular South Tyrolean card game. The models have been generated, starting from a random player, through iterations of self-plays followed by the training of a neural network. The research has been carried out implementing Watten in various ways and using different neural networks. A mobile application has been implemented in order to play against different learned models." %}

  content="Very large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of integrating or embedding hundreds of thousands of transistors on a single silicon semiconductor microchip. This is the project work of the Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization course of the Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence of the Univeristy of Bologna. The same problem has been adressed using four different paradigms: CP, SAT, SMT, MIP." %}

  title="NLP course projects"
  link="https://github.com/Chavelanda/NLP"
  inverted=""
  content="For the Natural Language Processing course of the university of Bologna, I implemented, together with my colleagues, three small projects. The first involved Part-of-speech (POS) tagging using simple RNN architectures. The second one aimed at fine-tuning transformer models to become capable of producing answers to given questions in the form of free text. The last one required the implementation of NLP models capable to classify Human values on which a specific text relies on." %}

  link="https://github.com/Chavelanda/connect_four"
  inverted="_i"
  content="As project for the Languages and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence course, it is proposed a Prolog implementation of the famous game Connect 4. It has been developed an Intelligent Agent that is able to play against a skilled human player. To decide its moves, the agent uses the minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and an heuristic specifically designed for this project." %}
